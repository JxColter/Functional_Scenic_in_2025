# Functional_Scenic_in_2025

Having trouble with Scenic in 2025? I've isolated dependencies and input structure to get this working in 3 simple commands, on both Windows and Linux (HPC) command line interfaces (CLIs).

This code assumes that you have processed your code and have an expression_matrix in loom format (for now).

GRNBoost2 requires arboreto_with_multiprocessing.py script to circumvent pyscenic incompatibilities.

Once compatibilities between library states for grnboost2 and ctx/auc have been consolidated, the environment setup will be updated accordingly.
